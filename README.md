# ESP8266 MBED MQTT Library

### Library for the STM32 with an ESP8266 Module to use MQTT

This library is for connecting a STM32 microcontroller via MQTT to other MQTT Devices

### Configuration
For the configuration, you must copy the [mbed_app.json](mbed_app.json) file to the same directory as the platform.ini file.


### Credits
The code was originally written by Jack Hansdampf on mbed for use with Keil Studio (Cloud).

I have just ported it, so that it works with PlatformIO. 
So if there are any bugs, I am not the one who is to blame :^) (You can still tell me and I will try to fix them)

The MQTT library used has been modified so that it can be used with PlatformIO. 
All credit and copyright for this library goes to the original creators (https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-mqtt)

I know that the library can probably be ported better. 
But this works :^)
